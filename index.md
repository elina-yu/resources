"In light of the growing wave of anti-Asian violence under COVID-19, we wanted to contextualize current racial tensions between Black and Asian communities within a historical analysis of Black and Asian solidarity in New York City. Through this discussion we hope to lift up examples of how our communities have come together in other times of crisis in this city, and to imagine better responses to violence than to dismiss anti-Asian violence or to call the police as a solution."

### Stroll and EDM: The origins of culture you participate in
"As participants in hip hop culture, we think it is CRUCIAL to express the fundamental belief that black LIVES matter. Not just black cultural products, like hip hop. We would not be here without the BLACK LIVES responsible for creating the art form we practice every day. We will not be complicit in the erasure of black bodies from the mainstream of the culture." - Jillian Roberts, Mint Dance Team.

A series of articles. “The 1619 Project is an ongoing initiative from The New York Times Magazine that began in August 2019, the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery.

#### - [Color-Blindness Is Counterproductive](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/color-blindness-is-counterproductive/405037/)
“Many sociologists, though, are extremely critical of colorblindness as an ideology. They argue that as the mechanisms that reproduce racial inequality have become more covert and obscure than they were during the era of open, legal segregation, the language of explicit racism has given way to a discourse of colorblindness. But they fear that the refusal to take public note of race actually allows people to ignore manifestations of persistent discrimination.”

#### - [Police officers convicted for fatal shootings are the exception, not the rule](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/police-officers-convicted-fatal-shootings-are-exception-not-rule-n982741)
“Nearly five years after Michael Brown’s death and mass protests in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked a national conversation about policing, a set of patterns have emerged. Those killed are disproportionately black and more often than not blamed for their own deaths or demonized in the process. Police officers facing questions about the use of force do not always tell the truth or face penalties when they lie. Prosecutors who must face voters at election time and work with police officers each day are often loathe to bring charges. When they do, juries and judges are reticent to convict.”
