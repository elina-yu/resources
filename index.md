We will not be complicit in the erasure of black bodies from the mainstream of the culture." - Jillian Roberts, Mint Dance Team.

<br> “Nearly five years after Michael Brown’s death and mass protests in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked a national conversation about policing, a set of patterns have emerged. Those killed are disproportionately black and more often than not blamed for their own deaths or demonized in the process. Police officers facing questions about the use of force do not always tell the truth or face penalties when they lie. Prosecutors who must face voters at election time and work with police officers each day are often loathe to bring charges. When they do, juries and judges are reticent to convict.”
